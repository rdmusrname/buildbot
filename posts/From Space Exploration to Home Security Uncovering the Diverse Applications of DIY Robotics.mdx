## Cosmic  Constructions: DIY Robotics in Space Exploration


Humankind's fascination with the  cosmos has spurred a relentless quest to explore the vast frontiers of space. Once confined  to the realm of government agencies and well-funded organizations space exploration is now witnessing a surge of involvement from DIY robotics enthusiasts.  These intrepid individuals are harnessing the power of DIY  robotics to develop low-cost modular, and versatile solutions that  address the unique challenges of extraterrestrial environments.


One  notable example is the ElectroVoxels project, spearheaded by researchers  at MIT's CSAIL. These cube-shaped  robots can assemble  into various shapes using  electromagnetism, drawing  inspiration from  the modular robots depicted in the movie Big Hero 6. The potential applications of ElectroVoxels in space exploration are far-reaching. Astronauts could deploy them to build furniture, construct habitats, and even repair  satellites  in zero  gravity. Their  compact size and  low cost  make them an attractive option for reducing the payload of rockets a significant factor in  space missions.
